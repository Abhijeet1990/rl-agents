# rl-agents

A collection of Reinforcement Learning agents

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eleurent/rl-agents.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eleurent/rl-agents/)

## Installation

`pip install --user git+https://github.com/eleurent/rl-agents`

## Usage

Most experiments can be run from `scripts/experiments.py`

```
Usage:
  experiments evaluate <environment> <agent> (--train|--test)
                                             [--episodes <count>]
                                             [--seed <str>]
                                             [--analyze]
  experiments benchmark <benchmark> (--train|--test)
                                    [--processes <count>]
                                    [--episodes <count>]
                                    [--seed <str>]
  experiments -h | --help

Options:
  -h --help            Show this screen.
  --analyze            Automatically analyze the experiment results.
  --episodes <count>   Number of episodes [default: 5].
  --processes <count>  Number of running processes [default: 4].
  --seed <str>         Seed the environments and agents.
  --train              Train the agent.
  --test               Test the agent.
```

The `evaluate` command allows to evaluate a given agent on a given environment. For instance,

```bash
# Train a DQN agent on the CartPole-v0 environment
$ python3 experiments.py evaluate envs/cartpole.json agents/dqn.json --train --episodes=200
```

The environments are described by their [gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) registration `id`
```JSON
{
    "id":"CartPole-v0"
}
```

And the agents by their class, and configuration dictionary.

```JSON
{
    "__class__": "<class 'rl_agents.agents.dqn.pytorch.DQNAgent'>",
    "model": {
        "type": "DuelingNetwork",
        "layers": [512, 512]
    },
    "gamma": 0.99,
    "n_steps": 1,
    "batch_size": 32,
    "memory_capacity": 50000,
    "target_update": 1,
    "exploration": {
        "method": "EpsilonGreedy",
        "tau": 50000,
        "temperature": 1.0,
        "final_temperature": 0.1
    }
}
```

If keys are missing from these configurations, default values will be used instead.

Finally, a batch of experiments can be scheduled in a _benchmark_.
All experiments are then executed in parallel on several processes.

```bash
# Run a benchmark of several agents interacting with environments
$ python3 experiments.py benchmark cartpole_benchmark.json --test --processes=4
```

A benchmark configuration files contains a list of environment configurations and a list of agent configurations.

```JSON
{
    "environments": ["envs/cartpole.json"],
    "agents":["agents/dqn.json", "agents/mcts.json"]
}
```



## Agents

The following agents are currently implemented:

### [Double DQN](rl_agents/agents/dqn)

A neural-network model is used to estimate the state-action value function and produce a greedy optimal policy.

### [Monte Carlo Tree Search](rl_agents/agents/tree_search/mcts.py)

A world transition model is leveraged for trajectory search. A search tree is expanded by efficient random sampling so as to focus the search around the most promising moves.
